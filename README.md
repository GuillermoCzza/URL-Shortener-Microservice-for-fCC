# URL Shortener Microservice

Node.js URL shortener application.

In order to choose the PORT and the MONGO_URI (valid MongoDB URI string), you must fill said variables out in the .env file. The port is 3000 by default, and I've left the MONGO_URI variable empty for GitHub, for obvious reasons.
 
Made from freeCodeCamp's boilerplate code for the URL Shortener Microservice (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice).
